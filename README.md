# Free fall model
**A Python model of objects in free fall with air resistance**

With some information about an object´s physical attributes, the model can be used to perform different calculations on a fall from any height above the ground. 

**Roadmap**

* The API of this library is frozen. It will only be changed if issues arise that can not be handled otherwise.
* The library uses semantic versioning.
